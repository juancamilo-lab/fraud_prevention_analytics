# Rule-Based Fraud Detection Systems

This directory contains examples and resources for implementing rule-based fraud detection systems.  Rule-based systems offer a straightforward approach to identifying potentially fraudulent transactions or user behavior by defining specific criteria that trigger alerts.  While simpler than machine learning models, they are valuable for their transparency, ease of implementation, and ability to capture easily identifiable fraudulent patterns.

## Contents

This section includes Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the application of various rule-based systems and Python scripts for creating and evaluating rules.  The examples use [Specify Data Source - e.g., simulated data, a publicly available dataset (link to dataset), anonymized data (mention anonymization techniques)].

### Notebooks:

* **`transaction_amount_rules.ipynb`:**  Demonstrates rule-based detection based on transaction amounts.  Explores different threshold values and their impact on accuracy (precision, recall, F1-score).
* **`frequency_rules.ipynb`:**  Illustrates how to detect fraudulent activity based on the frequency of transactions within a specific time window.  Examines the effect of varying time windows and frequency thresholds.
* **`location_rules.ipynb`:**  Shows how to identify potentially fraudulent transactions based on the location of transactions relative to the user's usual activity.  This includes techniques for handling missing location data.
* **`velocity_rules.ipynb`:**  Covers rule-based detection focusing on the rapid changes in transaction frequency or amount (velocity).
* **`behavioral_rules.ipynb`:**  (If included) Demonstrates how to create rules based on user behavior patterns, such as unusual spending habits or login attempts.


### Python Scripts:

* **`rule_engine.py`:**  (If included) Contains reusable functions or classes for applying rules, evaluating results, and generating reports.


## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install dependencies:**  Install the necessary Python libraries (primarily `pandas` and potentially others, list them here).
3. **Run the notebooks:**  Open the Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred IDE and execute the code cells.  The notebooks are designed to be self-explanatory, with clear explanations of the rules and their implementation.
4. **Modify and experiment:**  Feel free to modify the parameters of the rules, experiment with different data, and explore the impact on the results.

## Limitations of Rule-Based Systems

It is crucial to understand the limitations of rule-based systems:

* **Limited Adaptability:**  Rule-based systems are not very adaptable to evolving fraud patterns.  New rules need to be added manually as fraudsters develop new techniques.
* **Potential for False Positives/Negatives:**  Improperly defined rules can lead to a high number of false positives (flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent) or false negatives (failing to identify fraudulent transactions).
* **Difficult to handle complex patterns:** Rule-based systems might struggle to detect complex or unusual fraud patterns that do not fit easily defined rules.

## Future Enhancements

Future work will include:

*  Adding more complex rule combinations and strategies.
*  Exploring methods to automatically learn or optimize rule parameters.
*  Incorporating techniques to reduce false positives and false negatives.
